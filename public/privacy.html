      <h2>General Terms and Conditions</h2>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>Welcome to our website. These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for the use of our website.</p>
        <p>
            By entering the competition, Entrants are deemed to have read and accepted the terms and conditions.
            Contact details must be provided to the Promoter by the Entrant as specified on the competition. It is the responsibility of the Entrant to ensure the Promoter has the correct contact details for claiming of any prizes.  <br><br>
            The Entrant agrees by submitting their contact details these may be held by the Promoter for necessary reasons under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Promoter may need to disclose these details under any Freedom of Information request or legal/financial reasons of the Promoter. <br><br>
            The competition is run by the Promoter and is only open to Entrants over the age of 18 located in Great Britain. Photo ID may be requested to verify proof of age when claiming any prize that is won. Further documents may be requested if we are not fully satisfied. <br><br>
            By entering the competition, the Entrant understands that payment of the entry fee does not guarantee that they will win a prize. <br><br>
            The maximum number of entries per person will vary by competition. This value will be displayed in the product description of each prize. <br><br>
            Entrants accept responsibility that entering the competition does not contravene any laws in their country of residence. The Promoter does not accept any responsibility for the Entrant entering the competition illegally.
            The competition administration and activities are governed by law in Great Britain and this is accepted by the Entrant. <br><br>
            All entries to the competition become the property of the Promoter and cannot be returned to the Entrant after submission. <br><br>
            The Promoter does not guarantee the value of the prize and is not liable for any customer faults at the time of exchange to the winning Entrant. <br><br>
            The Promoter reserves the right to refuse or disqualify any Entrant if they are believed to have contravened any of the terms and conditions or acted in an illegal manner. The decision of the Promoter is final.
            We have a 15-minute time allowance to receive a successful payment confirmation before your selected ticket numbers go back on the board for re-purchase.  We will not be liable for any losses that incur as a result of failed payments.  It is your responsibility to check your entry has made it onto the entry list after purchase.  If you do not receive an email confirmation within the 15 minute time allowance then it is likely that the payment has failed. <br><br>
            Entrants will be asked to provide their contact details and card payment details. Once the entry is submitted, payment will be taken from the payment card number supplied.
            Entry to the competition is non-refundable unless the competition is cancelled by the Promoter.
            The decision of the Promoter is final. No discussion will be entered into regarding winners of prizes or any other decisions made by the Promoter. <br><br>
            The Entrant understands and agrees that the requirements to provide the goods within 30 days under the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 shall not apply this competition or prizes.
            Postal Entry Method: The Competition can be entered by a postal entry route. To enter via this method the Entrant must first create a free account on the Website (if they do not already have one), and then send a postcard stating which competition they would like to enter, and the following personal details: Name, Address, Date of Birth, Contact Telephone Number, and the email address used to create the free account on the Website. A random ticket number will be allocated per postcard and emailed over confirmation of their ticket number. All competitions will have enough tickets reserved for at least 4 days to provide enough time for the postal entries to reach us. Entrants will have an equal chance of winning using the postal entry method as those that have paid to enter. Each postcard must have a first-class or second-class stamp or special express delivery. Requests for postal entries where the email address provided is not already associated with a free account on the Website will not be processed and will be discarded without notification. Requests for postal entries where the competition has already sold out will not be processed. Postal entries must be received at the Promoter’s address by 4pm the day before the draw date, as advertised on the applicable competition page and Facebook channel, in order for a free entry to be allocated. If a competition is sold out sooner, but after the initial 4-day postal period has passed, we may decide to draw the competition earlier, which everyone will be notified of by following our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PunkCompetitions" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> Any postal entries received after the competition has drawn a winner will be invalid. Free entries can only be allocated to active accounts. All entries must be sent using a postage service. Any entries received without a postal stamp will be invalid. Please do not hand deliver postal entries to the business address. Any entry sent to the registered office of the Company will not be valid as all entries must be sent to the address below. For the avoidance of any doubt, any entries posted or hand delivered to the business address of the Promoter will be invalid. Entries should be sent to the following address: <br><br>
