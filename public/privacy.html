                ​

                These conditions are governed by and interpreted following the laws of the United Kingdom, and the use
                of the United
                Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sales of Goods is expressly excluded. If your
                habitual residence is in
                the EU, and you are a consumer, you additionally possess the protection provided to you by obligatory
                provisions of the law

                non-exclusive jurisdiction of
                the courts of the UK, which means that you may make a claim to defend your consumer protection rights in
                regards to these

                Conditions of Use in the United Kingdom, or in the EU country in which you reside.

                DISPUTE RESOLUTION
                ​
                <h3>Informal Negotiations</h3>

                To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms
                of Use (each a
                “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and
                collectively, the “Parties”),
                the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided
                below) informally for at
                least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written
                notice from one Party to

                the other Party.
                <br>
                Binding Arbitration
                ​

                Any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties to this contract shall be determined by
                one arbitrator who will
                be chosen in accordance with the Arbitration and Internal Rules of the European Court of Arbitration
                being part of the
                European Centre of Arbitration having its seat in Strasbourg, and which are in force at the time the
                application for arbitration
                is filed, and of which adoption of this clause constitutes acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall be
                based in the United
                Kingdom. The language of the proceedings shall be English. Applicable rules of substantive law shall be
                the law of the

                United Kingdom.
                <h3>Restrictions</h3>
                ​

                The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.
                The full extent
                permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or
                authority for any Dispute
                to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no
                right or authority for any
                Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any
                other persons.

                Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration

                The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning
                informal negotiations
                binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any
                of the intellectual
                property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
                invasion of privacy, or
                unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or
                unenforceable, then neither
                Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be
                illegal or unenforceable and
                such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
                jurisdiction above, and the

                Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

                reach us.
                Entrants will have an equal chance of winning using the postal entry method as those that have paid to

                processed and will be discarded without notification. Requests for postal entries where the competition
                has already
                sold out will not be processed. Postal entries must be received at the Promoter’s address by 4pm the day

                free entry to

                we may decide
                to draw the competition earlier, which everyone will be notified of by following our Facebook page

                details provided by
                the Entrant, or by social media message from the Promoter’s official social media accounts (if the
                Entrant has
                previously messaged the Promoter via any of these platforms). The Promoter will attempt to contract the
                winning
                Entrant on at least three separate occasions via at least two different contact methods, to notify them
                of their win. If
                the winning Entrant cannot be contacted within 14 days from the end of the competition, then the
                Promoter has the
                right to select an alternative winner from the prize draw. It is the responsibility of the Entrant to
                ensure the contact
                details are correct. The original winner cannot claim the prize once an alternative winner has been
                selected and
                the decision of the Promoter is final. <br>
                3. The prize winner will be selected at random using either a random ball machine or random number
                generator and
                this will be done live on the Promoter’s Facebook Page. The time and date of the draw will be advertised
                on the
                Promoter’s Facebook Page in advance and within 72 hours of the competition closing. There will be only
                one
                winner per competition unless otherwise specified. <br>
                4. If the prize of the competition is a motor vehicle it will be transferred from the Promoter to the
                winning Entrant using
                the V5 for the vehicle. This must be completed before the vehicle is handed over and it is the
                responsibility of the
                winner to tax and insure the vehicle and the Promoter will not be responsible for the vehicle once
                handed over. <br>
                5. The Promoter is the owner of the prize until such time as it is handed over to the winning Entrant.
                It is the
                responsibility of Entrant to make any enquiries or legal advice before entering the competition as the
                Promoter
                does not hold any responsibility for the valuation of the prize. <br>
                6. The prize will be delivered by the Promoter either in person or via a courier/delivery service.
                Standard delivery of

                redelivery
                charges. <br>
                7. The Promoter is not responsible for any courier/delivery service Prizes that are lost or broken in
                transit. <br>

                8. By entering the competition, the Entrant is agreeing to (i) their full name being displayed on the
                prize competition
                page; and (ii) their full name and town of residence being displayed on the Promoter’s Website and
                Facebook
                Page if they are a winner. This may include photographs and videos that will be used as promotional
                material on
                the Website and Facebook Page. <br>
                9. The Promoter reserves the right to cancel the competition at any time before or after entries have
                been submitted.
                If the competition is cancelled, any entry fees will be refunded either by bank card or cheque. Once the
                fee is
                returned the entry to the competition is cancelled. <br>
                10. The Promoter shall not be responsible for any loss (including economic loss) suffered or sustained
